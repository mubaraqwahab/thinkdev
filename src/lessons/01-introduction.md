1. Install these software on your computer; they'll provide us the environment to write and run JavaScript programs.
   * [Node.js v14+](https://nodejs.org/en/)
   * [Visual Studio Code (<abbr>VS Code</abbr>)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   * A terminal. You can use the default terminals on Mac and Linux; on Windows, use [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. Create a new JavaScript file in VS Code, type code in it to display your name, and run the file.

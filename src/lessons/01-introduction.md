## {{ iconed("Exercise") }}

1. Install these software on your computer; they'll provide us the environment to write and run JavaScript programs.
   * [Node.js v14+](https://nodejs.org/en/)
   * [Visual Studio Code (<abbr>VS Code</abbr>)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   * A terminal. You can use the default terminals on Mac and Linux; on Windows, use [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
1. (Optional) Customise VS Code by choosing a theme, etc.
1. Create a new JavaScript file, type code in it to display your name, and run the file.


## {{ iconed("Extras") }}

You'll find an "extras" section in the lesson pages. This is where I'll put some additional material that I left out of the slides. I _strongly_ encourage you to read them.

### Node.js

I said that we'd be running our JavaScript code with Node.js. We don't actually need Node for this; our computers already have browsers that can run JavaScript. However, I feel it would be somewhat distracting working in the browser, especially because we won't be creating a web app or anything like that. (We may build _parts_ of a web app though üôÉ.) Also, one of the goals of this course is to learn to work in a terminal, and using Node forces us to do so.

Outside of the browser, Node isn't the only place where we can run JavaScript. There's also [Deno](https://deno.land/). It's new, and it was created by Node's creator, Ryan Dahl, to address some of Node's issues. (You can watch Ryan's [initial announcement of Deno](https://youtu.be/M3BM9TB-8yA), if you're curious.) Of course, we'll prefer Node over Deno because it's more mature and better-known; Node was released in 2009, whereas Deno was released in 2018.

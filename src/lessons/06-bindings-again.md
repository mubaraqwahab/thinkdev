### One declaration, many variables

We know how to declare many variables:

```js
let a = 1;
let b = 2;
```

We can also do these in the same declaration (note the use of the comma `,`):

```js
let a = 1, b = 2;
```

This works with `const` too:

```js
const a = 1, b = 2;
```

### Keywords and reserved words

TODO: introduce the two terms; differentiate btw them; their similarities for our purposes.

A word with a special meaning in a programming language is called a <i>keyword</i>. Most keywords in JavaScript are also reserved words &mdash; that is, they're not valid identifiers. Examples are `if`, `else`, `typeof`, and `null`.

## Credits

* This course is loosely based on the book ["Think Python" by Allen Downey](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/). The book is also known by the title _How to Think Like a Computer Scientist_. Yes, it inspired this course's title.
* The slides were made with [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/).

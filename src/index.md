## Credits

* This course is loosely based on the book ["Think Python" by Allen Downey](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/). The book is also known by the title, _How to Think Like a Computer Scientist_. Yes, it inspired this course's title.
* My primary reference is the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript). It's a great place to learn JavaScript and other things web-related.
* I made the slides with [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) and I'm very pleased with it ðŸ˜Š.

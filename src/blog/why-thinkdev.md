It started the semester after the COVID lockdown, in our final year. I got worried that some of us still weren't comfortable writing simple programs. One of my regrets then (and more so now) was that I wasn't so proactive. If someone met me with a problem, I would help with what I could; but I never _offered_ to help unless I was asked. I was "minding my business" too much. It wasn't a healthy attitude, so I wanted to do things differently by volunteering to teach a programming course.

I had some things planned in my head. I would host a physical class on weekends for our coursemates and even other interested students. I chose to teach Python, because, at the time, I felt it was the best language for introducing programming to people; Python uses fewer symbols and more English words, it's a general-purpose language, and it's fairly well designed. I was going to use the book <i>[Think Python](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python/)</i> (also known as <i>How to Think Like a Computer Scientist</i>) as a guide.

But that didn't happen. Perhaps I thought that the COVID restrictions at the time would prevent me from gathering people in a physical class. Or that people would be reluctant to come to school on weekends for a non-school-related class. Rather, I was just hesitant.

So I changed some plans. I would prerecord lessons and publish them on YouTube. I would also hold Zoom meetings to discuss the lessons.

But that too didn't happen. My laptop keyboard got damaged and some time later, when I fixed it, we were already occupied with our final projects and I didn't want the course to be a distraction to people. Then again, I was hesitant.

Months went by, and the idea came again. This time, I would host the course content on a mini website. I would keep the audience small so I could ensure that no one's left behind. And I would teach JavaScript instead. I made this switch because I was a lot more familiar with JavaScript and it's use in practice. I would still use the <i>Think Python</i> book though, and even name the course after the book.

After yet another episode of hesitation, I proposed the course to two people. They agreed and I was pleased.

How I began the course, in its form today, was quite unusual of me. I really wanted to just get it started. I built a very simple site quickly and prepared the introductory slides. I only planned (vague) the first few topics we would cover. I chose the title "thinkdev" as a placeholder, hoping to change it sometime later.

I think it was good I did as i did though.

Bla bla ... it's weird ... thoughts ... I had to get this off my chest.

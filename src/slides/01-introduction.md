### Why?

* It's a ubiquitous language; it's the "language" used in browsers, it's also used to build desktop and mobile apps, backends, command line programs, and developer tools!  {.fragment .fade-up}
* It is, for the 9th year, the most popular language ([Source](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#section-most-popular-technologies-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages){rel=noopener}) {.fragment .fade-up}
* It's an interpreted, dynamic language (for now, this means it's easy to get started with it) {.fragment .fade-up}
* It's the language I'm most accustomed to 🙃 {.fragment .fade-up}

- course goals
- what to expect
- what not to expect
- motivation
- we'll use JavaScript
- why js?
- what we'll cover
- software we'll use
- course format (schedule, exercises, etc.)
- resources (course website, think python)
- editor tour (workspaces, terminal, settings, theme)
  - opening a workspace
  - theme and icon theme
  - extensions
  - terminal
  - settings
  - command palette
  - my editor in later meetings
- node quick test
